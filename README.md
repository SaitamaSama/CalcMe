It is a basic day to day activity listing application made entirely on HTML5, CSS3 and javaScript
It would have the functionalities to add delete and mark the activities.
the user interface would be simple and would not have any kind of login/ signup thing
completely a day list. Might be adding some new features later.

For now I will make this a calculator. and transform it to a tod list.
